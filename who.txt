Let's start a discussion about who documentaiton is for and resolves some merge conflicts

for oneself
for peers
for supervisors
for an unknown interested party who you want to discover
for comercial/academic community
for my mum
for the group that we feel represented by (gender, ethnicities, religions, etc.) which might prove possible to do this
instagram is difficult, platform for work
to people who want to buy work or to people who want to appreciate for non comercial reasons 
for the blob of social media
is twitter and insta somewhere to just put things?
have to be careful with documentation incase there is thievery of ideas
the endless capitalisation of art affects audience
potentially for a small audience not on socaial media, like seeing something in real life

•myself (at different points in time )•
others making something related•
assessors, reviewers, 
funders (for a specific purpose)
institutions: 
people who want to commission/employ/collaborate/ me•
ANY OR ALL OF THE ABOVE AT THE SAME TIME
